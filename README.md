<h1>News App developed with React Native</h1>

<p>This mobile app uses WordPress Rest API, the Wordpress Website uses my public repository that it is a Wordpress plugin that extends
functionality of the Wordpress API, and also it contains an admin menu to handle some configurations of the mobile app</p>

<h2>Project under functionality</h2>
This project is being developed for learning purposes of React Native, because I have basic knowledment on React native I am developing
this to understand more about React Native and for professional purposes.

<h2>How to use this</h2>
<p>To use this project download it and download my repository called 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AlastorReach/Flutter-app-Wordpress-Plugin"><b>FluterAppWordpressPlugin</b></a></p>
<p>Also you need to install the following Wordpress Plugin, because the FlutterAppWordpressPlugin is still under development
and it uses: <a target="_blank" href="https://es.wordpress.org/plugins/mp-timetable/"><b>The Wordpress Timetable Plugin</b></a> and I do not know
what happen if the Time table plugin is not installed, I have to code more in that plugin.</p>

<h2>What does this project do for now?</h2>
<p>For now this project shows news from an Wordpress Rest API, so you need to change the link provided in 
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AlastorReach/TVSurCanal14ReactNative/blob/master/src/common/components/TabScreen.js"><TabScreen /></a></p>
<p>Also the app shows live TV, yo need to indicate some url to watch video</p>
